HumanMarkup
===========

A try to markup text, that is not marked up

Actually, there is no easy way for non-techies to mark up text for the internet. HTML and mark-down are way too geeky and WYSIWYG-editors are mainly producing bad code. With Human Markup we want to define some rules to mark up normal text only by interpreting punctuation marks, paragraphs and apostrophes.
