# Human Markup

A try to markup text, that is not marked up

Actually, there is no easy way for non-techies to mark up text for the internet. HTML and mark-down 
are way too geeky and WYSIWYG-editors are mainly producing bad code. With Human Markup we want to 
define some rules to mark up normal text only by interpreting punctuation marks, paragraphs and apostrophes.

There are a lot of tools like Twitter, Skype or Chat-Clients in general, which doesn't support any kind of rich text
but nevertheless, users find ways to work around these "problems" by using paragraphs or CAPITALS to "markup" there
texts. So, what if we try to adapt these patterns for blogs or cms' systems?

## Adapting from MarkDown

Not everything on MarkDown is geeky. Let's use some patterns that "normal" people will understand.
